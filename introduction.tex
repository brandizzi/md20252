Containers and orchestrators like Kubernetes are now essential for deploying scalable applications. One of their core features, auto-scaling, balances performance and cost as workloads fluctuate.

However, for Java applications such as Liferay DXP, standard metrics like CPU and memory usage can be misleading due to JVM behavior, and long startup times make reactive scaling less effective.

This work explores two complementary strategies: leveraging internal JVM metrics and applying time series models to predict workload peaks. Our goal is to enable more proactive and reliable auto-scaling in containerized Java environments.
