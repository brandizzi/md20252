Auto-scaling is vital in Kubernetes, yet standard CPU and memory metrics often fail for Java applications, where JVM behavior masks true resource demands and slow startups hinder responsiveness. This paper explores improving auto-scaling for Liferay DXP, a Java-based web platform, by combining internal JVM metrics with SARIMAX-based time series forecasting to anticipate workload peaks and trigger proactive scaling. Experiments using data from our corporate site reveal significant limitations of this model in our current setup. While deployment validation remains future work, this study lays groundwork for integrating predictive methods into Kubernetes scaling.
